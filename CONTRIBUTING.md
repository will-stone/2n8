# Contributing

Before submitting pull requests, please raise an issue or discussion on GitHub to discuss the
changes you'd like to propose. This way we are all aligned on the direction of the library before
you take the time to update code and prepare anything for submission.

## Package manager

This project uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. Please install the version stated in
the `package.json` file, then run the following command to install all dependencies.

```sh
pnpm i
```

## Commit message style

This project follows the [Commits With Character](https://commits-with-character.org/) git commit
rules. The consumer is anyone using the 2n8 npm package, and the character prefixes should only be
added when changes are made that would affect the users of that package.
