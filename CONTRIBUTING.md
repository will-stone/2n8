# Contributing

Before submitting pull requests, please raise an issue or discussion on GitHub
to discuss the changes you'd like to propose. This way we are all aligned on the
direction of the library before you take the time to update code and prepare
anything for submission.

## Package manager

This project uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. Please install
the version stated in the `package.json` file, then run the following command to
install all dependencies.

```sh
pnpm i
```

## Commit message style

This project follows the
[Commits With Character](https://commits-with-character.org/) git commit rules.
The consumer is anyone using the 2n8 npm package, and the character prefixes
should only be added when changes are made that would affect the users of that
package.
