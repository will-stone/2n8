State values based on one or more other state values, known as derived state,
can be created using _getters_.

```tsx title="store.ts"
import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  counter = 0
  secondCounter = 10

  get totalCounters() {
    return this.counter + this.secondCounter
  }
}

export const useStore = createReactStore(new Store())
```

Any subscribers to `totalCounters` will update when either `counter` or
`secondCounter` are updated.

```tsx title="Component.tsx"
import { useStore } from './store'

const Component = () => {
  const totalCounters = useStore('totalCounters')

  return <div>{totalCounters}</div>
}
```
