import { Code, Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { counter, zustand, mobx } from '../code-snippets.js'

2n8 feels like a blend between two excellent state management libraries:
[Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) and [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/).
Therefore, here's a quick comparison with those two packages.

<Aside>
  There are always compromises. 2n8 aims for simplicity when setting up your
  store code using TypeScript, but the other two libraries mentioned here are
  far more mature and have a great ecosystem and community. Please use the tool
  that best suits your use case.

## Boilerplate

The main reason for creating 2n8 was to limit the amount of boilerplate and
repetition required to make a store when using TypeScript. Here's a simple
counter example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="2n8">
    <Code showLineNumbers code={counter} lang="tsx" title="Counter.tsx" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Zustand">
    <Code showLineNumbers code={zustand} lang="tsx" title="Counter.tsx" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MobX">
    <Code showLineNumbers code={mobx} lang="tsx" title="Counter.tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, 2n8 requires the least store boilerplate whereas MobX needs
less component binding.

The advantage of 2n8's concise store implementation is that it doesn't require
external type definitions or an initial state object. TypeScript can infer types
inside the class too; take another look at the 2n8 example, there's no types in
sight, but this store automatically has the correct types for both state and
actions.
