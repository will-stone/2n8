title: Async Actions
---

Running asynchronous actions is as simple as making an async method on your
store class.

```tsx title="store.ts"
import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

import { fetchData } from './data-fetcher'

class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  data: { id: string; name: string }[] = []

  async loadDataButtonClicked() {
    this.data = await fetchData()
  }
}
```

As state is only emitted at the **end** of actions, you may find you'd like to
emit earlier to trigger state changes in your app. For this you can use the
special `$emit` action.

```tsx title="store.ts" {11}
import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

import { fetchData } from './data-fetcher'

class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  data: { id: string; name: string }[] = []
  status: 'idle' | 'pending' = 'idle'

  async loadDataButtonClicked() {
    this.status = 'pending'
    this.$emit()
    this.data = await fetchData()
    this.status = 'idle'
  }
}
```

:::note

All state currently set within the store will be emitted when you call the
`$emit` action. This includes changes made by other actions made in this time.
