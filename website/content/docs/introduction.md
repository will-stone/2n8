A lightweight state management library that uses a class-based store in
JavaScript and TypeScript.

Key features include:

- Automatic change detection for instance properties.
- Built-in subscription system for reactive updates.
- Flexible state reset functionality.
- Type-safe state management.
- Minimal boilerplate.

Leveraging JavaScript's Proxy mechanism, the library creates self-tracking state
containers with a simple, powerful approach to state management.
