import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

## Introduction

A lightweight JavaScript / TypeScript state management library that uses a
class-based store.

Key features include:

- Automatic change detection for instance properties.
- Built-in subscription system for reactive updates.
- Flexible state reset functionality for entire state or specific fields.
- Type-safe state management.
- Minimal boilerplate.

Leveraging JavaScript's Proxy mechanism, the library creates self-tracking state
containers with a simple, powerful approach to state management.

## Installation

<PackageManagers pkg="2n8" pkgManagers={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']} />
