import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Steps>

1. State is initiated using a class. This class must be extended from 2n8's
   parent class which enhances the store with a few utilities.

   ```tsx
   import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

   class Store extends TwoAndEight {
     counter = 0
   }
   ```

2. State changes are made inside _actions_, which are simply class methods.

   ```tsx
   import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

   class Store extends TwoAndEight {
     counter = 0
     timestamp = 0

     addButtonClicked() {
       this.counter++
     }
   }
   ```

   When actions are called, any state mutations are auto _emitted_ to
   subscribers at the end of the action. If you need to emit early, you can use
   the special inbuilt `this.$emit()` action.

   ```tsx
   import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

   class Store extends TwoAndEight {
     counter = 0
     data: { id: string; title: string }[]

     async addButtonClicked() {
       this.counter++
       this.$emit()
       this.data = await fetchData()
     }
   }
   ```

3. Generate your React hook:

   ```tsx
   import { createReactStore } from '2n8'

   const useStore = createReactStore(new Store())
   ```

   This uses React's
   [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)
   hook to map emitted state to selectors:

   ```tsx
   const Component = () => {
     const counter = useStore((s) => s.counter)

     return <div>{counter}</div>
   }
   ```

   When, and only when, the selected state changes, the component is rerendered
   by React. This is more optimal than simply passing state down the component
   tree via props.

4. Select and call actions from the store:

   ```tsx
   const Component2 = () => {
     const addButtonClicked = useStore((s) => s.addButtonClicked)

     return <button onClick={addButtonClicked}>Add</button>
   }
   ```

</Steps>
