<Steps>

1. Create your state using a class, extended from 2n8's parent class which
   enhances your store with a few utilities.

   ```tsx
   import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

   class Store extends TwoAndEight {
     counter = 0
     timestamp = 0
   }
   ```

2. Add your actions that update the state.

   ```tsx
   import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

   class Store extends TwoAndEight {
     counter = 0
     timestamp = 0

     addButtonClicked() {
       this.counter++
       this.timestamp = Date.now()
     }
   }
   ```

   State changes are auto _committed_ at the end of each action. If you need to
   commit early, you can use the special inbuilt `this.$commit()` action.

   ```tsx
   import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

   class Store extends TwoAndEight {
     counter = 0
     timestamp = 0
     data: { id: string; title: string }[]

     async addButtonClicked() {
       this.counter++
       this.timestamp = Date.now()
       this.$commit()
       this.data = await fetchData()
     }
   }
   ```

3. Generate your React hook:

   ```tsx
   import { createReactStore } from '2n8'

   const useStore = createReactStore(new Store())
   ```

   This uses React's `useSyncExternalStore` hook to map committed state to
   selectors:

   ```tsx
   const Component = () => {
     const counter = useStore((s) => s.counter)

     return <div>{counter}</div>
   }
   ```

   When, and only when, the selected state changes, the component is rerendered
   by React. This is more optimal than simply passing state down the component
   tree via props.
