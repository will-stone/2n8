_State_ is initiated using class fields. The class must be extended from 2n8's
parent class which enhances the store with a few utilities.

```tsx title="store.ts"
import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  counter = 0
}
```

State changes are made inside _actions_, which are simply class methods that
mutate the fields.

```tsx title="store.ts" {6-8}
import { TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  counter = 0

  addButtonClicked() {
    this.counter++
  }
}
```

Generate your React hook:

```tsx title="store.ts" {11} /{ (createReactStore)/
import { createReactStore, TwoAndEight } from '2n8'

class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  counter = 0

  addButtonClicked() {
    this.counter++
  }
}

export const useStore = createReactStore(new Store())
```

This uses React's
[`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)
hook to _subscribe_ to state changes:

```tsx title="Component.tsx"
import { useStore } from './store'

const Component = () => {
  const counter = useStore('counter')

  return <div>{counter}</div>
}
```

When, and only when, the selected state changes, the component is rerendered by
React. This is more optimal than simply passing state down the component tree
via props.

Select and call actions from the store:

```tsx title="Component2.tsx"
import { useStore } from './store'

const Component2 = () => {
  const addButtonClicked = useStore('addButtonClicked')

  return <button onClick={addButtonClicked}>Add</button>
}
```

When actions are called, the current values of all state are _emitted_ to the
subscribers at the end of the action.
