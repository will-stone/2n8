## `TwoAndEight`

The abstract class that all stores must extend if you would like to use the
following utility methods. The class also
[auto-binds](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-bind) your actions so you don't
need to use arrow functions or bind methods in the constructor.

```ts
class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  // ...
}
```

### Fields

Custom fields are your state, and should only be mutated in your actions.

### Methods

Custom methods are your actions, and should be used to mutate state.

There are also some in-built actions. All in-built actions will always be
prefixed with a `$` to avoid clashing with your own action names.

#### `$emit`

```ts
$emit(): void
```

Emit to subscribers early instead of waiting until the end of the action. This
is useful in asynchronous actions where you may want subscribers to update
before the async event has finished.

```ts
class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  isFetching = false

  async actionName() {
    this.isFetching = true
    this.$emit()
    await fetchThing()
    this.isFetching = false
  }
}
```

#### `$reset`

```ts
$reset(stateName?: string): void
```

Call this to reset the state to its original value. Use a state name to reset a
single field of state, or call it without any arguments to reset _all_ state to
their original values.

```ts
this.$reset()
this.$reset('stateName')
```

```ts
class Store extends TwoAndEight {
  counter = 0

  resetCounter() {
    this.$reset('counter')
  }

  resetAll() {
    this.$reset()
  }
}
```

## `createReactStore`

```ts
createReactStore(store: Store extends TwoAndEight): useStore
```

Enhances a store instance, returning a React Hook with API utilities attached.
This should only be called _outside_ of components.

```ts
const useStore = createReactStore(new Store())

const Component = () => {
  const actionName = useStore('actionName')
  const stateName = useStore('stateName')
  // ...
}
```

### `useStore.store`

```ts
useStore.store: Store
```

A re-export of the store, useful in subscribers where hooks are not available.

### `useStore.subscribe`

```ts
useStore.subscribe(callback: () => void): () => void
```

Subscribes to state updates; registers a callback that fires whenever an action
emits. This can be used to trigger events when all or certain state changes.

```ts
useStore.subscribe(() => {
  writeCounterToFile(useStore.store.counter)
})
```

Note that this will be called on every emitted state from the store. If you'd
like to optimise, it is advisable to use `if` statements and an external cache:

```ts
let counterCache = useStore.store.counter

useStore.subscribe(() => {
  if (useStore.store.counter !== counterCache) {
    writeCounterToFile(useStore.store.counter)
  }
})
```

## `createStore`

```ts
createStore(store: Store extends TwoAndEight): store
```

This is the vanilla store creator used by `createReactStore`. You should only
need this if you are creating other, non-React, integrations with a 2n8 store.

### `store.store`

```ts
store.store: Store
```

A re-export of the store, useful in subscribers where hooks are not available.

### `store.subscribe`

```ts
store.subscribe(callback: () => void): () => void
```

Subscribes to state updates; registers a callback that fires whenever an action
emits. This can be used to trigger events when all or certain state changes.

### `store.getInitialState`

```ts
store.getInitialState(): Store
```

Returns the initial state snapshot, before any mutations have occurred.

## `clone`

```ts
clone(value: unknown): value
```

This is the internal value cloning tool used by the library. It is re-exported
for your convenience, in case you need to clone an external object or array in
an action to stop it being mutated when the state changes.
